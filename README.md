# CS370 Poject 2

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
For Project 2, I was responsible for writing the core logic inside the main loop of the application. I implemented the decision-making strategy that allowed the agent to choose between exploration and exploitation during training. The provided code gave a framework for the environment and the agent structure, but I developed the logic that drives the agent’s behavior and learning process.

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
When approaching a problem, I begin by forming a hypothesis about the solution and then work through testing and refining it. In computer science, this often means designing an algorithm, analyzing its efficiency, and iteratively debugging and optimizing it based on how it performs in real-world or simulated environments.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
My ethical responsibilities to the end user include ensuring transparency and fairness, especially when working with machine learning. This means acknowledging potential biases in training data, being clear about how the system works, and avoiding harm caused by opaque or misleading outcomes. For organizations, I have a duty to develop systems that are reliable, secure, and aligned with their goals—while still respecting user privacy and safety.
